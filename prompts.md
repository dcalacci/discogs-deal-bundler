thanks. now I want to improve the server. 

I want to find the best deals, so the listings that allow me to grab the most releases from my wantlist I can get for the least amount of money. This should consider seller shipping, too—when you buy multiple releases from one seller, the shipping is held constant (so 4 items with $22 shipping is the cost of the 4 items plus $22, not 4 * $22). 

I want to be able to give a total budget amount using a slider, and get a list of releases to buy that do the above.
